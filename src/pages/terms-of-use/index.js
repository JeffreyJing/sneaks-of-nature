            <p>1. SMART CONTRACT ENABLED</p>

            <p>
                Metarelics NFT is a non-fungible Ethereum-based token that uses smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain (“Smart Contracts”). The Ethereum blockchain provides 
                an immutable ledger of all transactions that occur on the blockchain. This means that all Metarelics NFTs are outside of the control of any one party, 
                including Metarelics, and are subject to many risks and uncertainties. Metarelics neither owns nor controls MetaMask, WalletConnect, the Ethereum network, your browser, 
                or any other third party site, product, or service (including third party wallets or marketplaces) that you might access, visit, or use for the purpose of enabling you 
                to use the Services or to purchase, list, auction, or sell Metarelics NFTs (“Transaction”), and that, except with respect to transferring control of a Metarelics NFT to 
                the initial purchaser through the Services (“Initial Purchaser”), Metarelics has no responsibility with respect to any Transaction. Metarelics will not be liable for the 
                acts or omissions of any third parties, nor will Metarelics be liable for any damage that you may suffer as a result of your transactions or any other interaction 
                with any third parties. You understand that your Ethereum public address will be made publicly visible whenever you engage in a Transaction. Aside from transferring 
                control of the Metarelics NFT to the Initial Purchaser, Metarelics has no control over the transfer, storage, ownership or maintenance of the Metarelics NFT.
            </p>

            <p>2. CHANGES TO THE SERVICES</p>

            <p>Metarelics reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Services (or any part thereof) with or without notice. You agree that Metarelics
                will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of the Services, including in relation to any Metarelics NFT.
            </p>

            <p>3. Metarelics PERKS</p>
            <p>
                A Collector (as defined below) of a Metarelics NFT may receive special perks, experience, or opportunities as determined by Metarelics in its sole discretion (“Perks”). 
                Metarelics does not make any representation or guarantee that any Collector will receive any Perks or achieve any particular outcome as a result of owning any Metarelics NFT. 
                Metarelics reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to restrict, limit, or deny any Perks to any Collector, including to limit the period of time when a Perk is available, 
                for any reason, at any time. Perks are not intended to be an endorsement of any project, creator, NFT, individual or any other thing, and Metarelics makes no recommendation and 
                provides no investment advice in connection with any Perks or otherwise as a result of holding or owning the Metarelics NFT.
            </p>

            <p>4. MEMBER ACCOUNT, PASSWORD, AND SECURITY</p>

            <p>
                You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password, if any, and are fully responsible for any and all activities that occur under your password 
                or account. You agree to (a) immediately notify Metarelics of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you exit from 
                your account at the end of each session when accessing the Services. Metarelics will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this Section.
            </p>

            <p>5. CONNECTING YOUR WALLET</p>

            <p>
                In order to access and use the Services, including engaging in a Transaction on the Services, you must connect your account to your digital wallet supported on MetaMask, 
                WalletConnect or other wallet extensions or gateways as allowed on the Services. Such digital wallets allow you to purchase, store, and engage in transactions using the native 
                Ethereum cryptocurrency, ETH. When you link your cryptocurrency wallet, you understand and agree that you are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your wallet and 
                your control over any wallet-related authentication credentials, private or public cryptocurrency keys, non-fungible tokens or cryptocurrencies that are stored in or are accessible 
                through your wallet. Any unauthorized access to your cryptocurrency wallet by third parties could result in the loss or theft of Metarelics NFTs and/or funds held in your wallet and 
                any associated wallets, including any linked financial information such as bank account(s) or credit card(s). Metarelics is not responsible for managing and maintaining the security 
                of your cryptocurrency wallet. Metarelics has no responsibility or liability to you for any unauthorized access to or use of your cryptocurrency wallet or if you are unable to locate 
                your credentials. If you notice any unauthorized or suspicious activity in your cryptocurrency wallet that seems to be related to the Services, please notify us immediately.
            </p>

            <p>6. SALE OF Metarelics NFT</p>

            <p>
                When each Metarelics NFT is sold for the first time, the agreement for sale is between Metarelics and the Initial Purchaser. If the Initial Purchaser decides to sell a Metarelics NFT 
                (“Secondary Sale”), then Metarelics is not a party to any agreement between the applicable buyer, seller, or facilitator of the Secondary Sale.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you or any owner of a Metarelics NFT (“Collector”) sells or transfers a Metarelics NFT to another collector, (a) the you, as Collector, represents and warrants that you will notify 
                the subsequent collector of these Terms and require the subsequent collector to comply with these Terms, (b) the Collector License (as defined below) as set forth herein will automatically 
                transfer to such subsequent collector, and such other collector will be deemed the “Collector” (for purposes of such Metarelics NFT and the Collector License to the underlying NFT IP 
                (as defined below)) and will be subject to these Terms, and (c) you, as the seller or transferor of such Metarelics NFT, will cease to have any further rights to such Metarelics NFT or 
                underlying NFT IP.
            </p>

            <p>
                By placing an order on the Site or through the Services (including by bidding in an auction), you agree that you are submitting a binding offer to purchase a Metarelics NFT, you agree to 
                pay all applicable fees associated with the Transaction, and you authorize Metarelics to automatically charge and collect such fees from your payment instrument or wallet. If you are an 
                Initial Purchaser, then all amounts due are to be paid to Metarelics. If you are not the Initial Purchaser of a Metarelics NFT, then amounts may be paid to the seller of such Metarelics NFT.
            </p>

            <p>
                You acknowledge and agree that Metarelics receives 10% of every Secondary Sale of a Metarelics NFT (“Royalty”). Metarelics has the right to collect Royalties for Metarelics sales in perpetuity. 
                As such, if you sell a Metarelics NFT on a third-party marketplace, you agree to include a statement substantially similar to the following in the description of the NFT: “10% Royalty Applies. 
                See Metarelics NFT Terms of Use for details.”
            </p>

            <p>No refunds are permitted except with respect to any statutory warranties or guarantees that cannot be excluded or limited by law.</p>

            <p>7. TAXES</p>

            <p>
                You are responsible for any and all sales, use, value-added and other taxes, duties, and assessments now or hereafter claimed or imposed by any governmental authority, associated with your use 
                of the Services, Perks or Metarelics NFTs (including, without limitation, any taxes that may become payable as the result of your ownership, transfer, purchase, or sale of a Metarelics NFT).
            </p>

            <p>8. Metarelics INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS</p>

            <p>
                You acknowledge and agree that the Services may contain content or features (“Services Content”) that are protected by copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret, or other proprietary rights 
                and laws. Except as expressly authorized by Metarelics, you agree not to modify, copy, frame, scrape, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the Services or 
                the Services Content, in whole or in part. Any use of the Services or the Services Content other than as specifically authorized herein is strictly prohibited.
            </p>

            <p>
                Metarelics's name and logos are trademarks and service marks of Metarelics (collectively the “Metarelics Trademarks”). Other company, product, and service names and logos used and displayed 
                via the Services may be trademarks or service marks of their respective owners who may or may not endorse or be affiliated with or connected to Metarelics. Nothing in these Terms or the Services 
                should be construed as granting, by implication, estoppel, or otherwise, any license or right to use any of Metarelics Trademarks displayed on the Services, without Metarelics's prior written 
                permission in each instance. All goodwill generated from the use of Metarelics Trademarks will inure to our exclusive benefit.
            </p>

            <p>9. YOUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS</p>

            <p>
                You acknowledge and agree that Metarelics (or, as applicable, its licensors) owns all legal rights, title and interest in all intellectual property rights of the content underlying Metarelics NFTs 
                (“NFT IP”), including but not limited to copyrights and trademarks in the NFT IP. As the copyright owner, Metarelics has the exclusive right to reproduce, prepare derivatives of, distribute, display, 
                perform and otherwise exercise and exploit the NFT IP, subject to Collector Licenses.
            </p>

            <p>
                Subject to continued compliance with these Terms, Metarelics grants Collector a limited, worldwide, non-assignable and non-transferable (except as part of a Secondary Sale), non-sublicensable, 
                royalty-free license to display the NFT IP solely for the Collector's non-commercial purposes (except as expressly permitted herein), including the right to display such NFT IP privately or publicly: 
                (i) for the purpose of promoting or sharing the Collector's purchase of, ownership of, or interest in such Metarelics NFT, (ii) for the purpose of sharing, promoting, discussing, or commenting on such
                Metarelics NFT or NFT IP; (iii) on third party marketplaces, exchanges, platforms, or applications in association with a Transaction of the Metarelics NFT; and (iv) within decentralized virtual 
                environments, virtual worlds, virtual galleries, virtual museums, or other navigable and perceivable virtual environments (the “Collector License”). While the Collector has the right to sell, trade, 
                transfer, or use their Metarelics NFT, the Collector may not make commercial use of the NFT IP.
            </p>

            <p>10. No Investment Advice; Investment Risks</p>

            <p>
                The information on this Site and any information provided in connection with the Services or Perks are provided to Metarelics NFT owners only and for information only and do not constitute, 
                and should not be construed as, investment advice or a recommendation to buy, sell, or otherwise transact in any digital asset including any products or services or an invitation, offer or 
                solicitation to engage in any investment activity with respect to any digital asset.
            </p>

            <p>
                The information on this Site and any information provided in connection with the Services or Perks provided to Metarelics NFT owners are provided solely on the basis that you will make your own 
                investment and trading decisions, and Metarelics does not take account of any person's investment objectives, particular needs, or financial situation. In addition, nothing on this Site or any 
                information provided in connection with the Services or Perks provided to Metarelics NFT owners shall, or is intended to, constitute financial, legal, accounting or tax advice. It is strongly 
                recommended that you seek professional investment advice before making any investment decision. Any investment decision that you make should be based on an assessment of your risks in consultation 
                with your investment advisor.
            </p>

            <p>
                The digital assets about which information is provided on the Site and any information provided in connection with the Services or Perks provided to Metarelics NFT owners are not viewed by the issuer 
                or sponsor of any such digital assets, or those buying or selling the digital asset, as securities under U.S. laws or relevant applicable laws. As a result it is unlikely that fulsome disclosures from 
                the issuer or sponsor, or any executive officer associated with the digital asset or related protocol have been provided, and others may have better or more information than the information made available
                to you via the Site, any information provided in connection with the Services or Perks provided to Metarelics NFT owners or to which you may independently have access.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are risks associated with purchasing and holding digital assets. Loss of the full amount of the purchase price is possible. Volatility is highly likely, and some of the protocols and platforms
                may fail entirely due to forking, flaws in the code, hacking or other malicious attacks.
            </p>

            <p>
                THESE TERMS DO NOT REPRESENT A COMPLETE STATEMENT OF RISK FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DIGITAL ASSETS OR PRODUCTS THAT MAY BE VIEWED OR TRACKED ON THIS SITE OR THAT MAY BE FEATURED OR DISCUSSED IN 
                CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES OR PERKS FOR METARELICS NFT OWNERS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THESE RISK WARNINGS CAREFULLY AND TAKE APPROPRIATE ADVICE BEFORE TAKING ANY DECISION TO PURCHASE OR TRADE A DIGITAL 
                ASSET.
            </p>

            <p>11. RESTRICTIONS</p>

            <p>
                You agree that you will not, and will not permit any third party to, do or attempt to do any of the following without the Metarelics's express prior written consent in each case:
            </p>
            <p>
                interfere with or disrupt the Services or servers or networks connected to the Services in any manner that could negatively affect or inhibit other Users from fully enjoying the Services or that could damage, disable, overburden or impair the functioning of the Services in any manner;
                violate any applicable local, state, national or international law, or any regulations having the force of law, including but not limited to the U.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), or which would involve proceeds of any unlawful activity;
                obtain or attempt to access or otherwise obtain any materials or information through any means not intentionally made available or provided for through the Services;
                use the Services or any Metarelics NFT or NFT IP to advertise or offer to sell or buy any goods or services for any purpose that is not specifically authorized herein;
                use the Services or any Metarelics NFT or NFT IP to further or promote any criminal activity or enterprise or provide instructional information about illegal activities, including for the purpose of concealing economic activity, laundering money, or financing terrorism; or
                use the Services or any Metarelics NFT or NFT IP to carry out financial activities subject to registration or licensing, including but not limited to creating, listing, or buying securities, commodities, options, real estate, or debt instruments.
            </p>
            
            <p>12. PRIVACY</p>

            <p>
                Our Privacy Policy is a part of these Terms. Please review the Privacy Policy, which also governs the Services and informs Users of our data collection practices.
            </p>

            <p>13. RISKS</p>
                
            <p>
                Please note the following risks in accessing, purchasing, selling or using Metarelics NFTs: The price and liquidity of blockchain assets, including Metarelics NFTs, are extremely volatile 
                and may be subject to large fluctuations. Fluctuations in the price of other digital assets could materially and adversely affect Metarelics NFTs, which may also be subject to significant 
                price volatility. Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal, or international level may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of Metarelics NFTs. 
                Metarelics NFTs are not legal tender and are not backed by any government. Transactions of Metarelics NFTs may be irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental 
                transactions may not be recoverable. Some Transactions of Metarelics NFTs shall be deemed to be made when recorded on a public ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that you 
                initiated the Transaction. The value of Metarelics NFTs may be derived from the continued willingness of market participants to exchange fiat currency or digital assets for Metarelics NFTs, 
                which may result in the potential for permanent and total loss of value of a particular Metarelics NFT.
            </p>

            <p>
                You agree and understand that you are solely responsible for determining the nature, potential value, suitability, and appropriateness of these risks for yourself, and that we do not give 
                advice or recommendations regarding Metarelics NFTs, including the suitability and appropriateness of, and investment strategies for, Metarelics NFTs. You agree and understand that you access 
                and use the Services, Metarelics NFTs, NFT IP, and Perks at your own risk; however, this brief statement does not disclose all of the risks associated with Metarelics NFTs and other digital assets. 
                You agree and understand that Metarelics will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using Metarelics NFTs, however 
                caused.
            </p>

            <p>14. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</p>

            <p>

                OF THE SERVICES, METARELICS NFTs, NFT IP OR PERKS WILL BE ACCURATE OR RELIABLE, OR (IV) THE QUALITY OF ANY SERVICES, METARELICS NFTs, NFT IP OR PERKS, OR ANY PRODUCTS, PLATFORMS, INFORMATION, OR OTHER 
                MATERIAL PURCHASED OR OBTAINED BY YOU THROUGH THE SERVICES, METARELICS NFTs OR PERKS WILL MEET YOUR EXPECTATIONS.

            <p>
                METARELICS NFTs ARE INTANGIBLE DIGITAL ASSETS. THEY EXIST ONLY BY VIRTUE OF THE OWNERSHIP RECORD MAINTAINED IN THE ETHEREUM NETWORK. ANY TRANSFER OF TITLE THAT MIGHT OCCUR IN ANY UNIQUE DIGITAL ASSET 
                OCCURS ON THE DECENTRALIZED LEDGER WITHIN THE ETHEREUM PLATFORM. WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT METARELICS CAN EFFECT THE TRANSFER OF TITLE OR RIGHT IN ANY METARELICS NFT.
            </p>

                costs (including, without limitation, court costs, costs of settlement and costs of pursuing indemnification and insurance), of every kind and nature whatsoever, whether known or unknown, foreseen 
                or unforeseen, matured or unmatured, or suspected or unsuspected, in law or equity, whether in tort, contract or otherwise (collectively, “Claims”), including, but not limited to, damages to property 
                or personal injury, that are caused by, arise out of or are related to (a) your use or misuse of the Site, the Services, Services Content, Metarelics NFTs, NFT IP or Perks, (b) your violation of these 
                Terms, or (c) your violation of the rights of a third party, including another User. You agree to promptly notify Metarelics of any third party Claims and cooperate with the applicable Indemnitee in 
                defending such Claims. You further agree that the Indemnitees shall have the right to control of the defense or settlement of any third party Claims. THIS INDEMNITY IS IN ADDITION TO, AND NOT IN LIEU 
                OF, ANY OTHER INDEMNITIES SET FORTH IN A WRITTEN AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND US.

            <p>17. TERMINATION RIGHTS</p>

            <p>
                You agree that Metarelics, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate your account (or any part thereof) or use of the Services or Perks and remove and discard any content within the Services, 
                for any reason, including, without limitation, for lack of use or if Metarelics believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these Terms. Any suspected 
                fraudulent, abusive or illegal activity that may be grounds for termination of your use of the Services or Perks may be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities. Metarelics may also in its 
                sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing the Services or Perks, or any part thereof, with or without notice. You agree that any termination of your access to the Services or Perks under 
                any provision of these Terms may be effected without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that Metarelics may immediately deactivate or delete your account and all related information and files in 
                your account and/or bar any further access to such files or the Services or Perks. Further, you agree that Metarelics will not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your access 
                to the Services or Perks.
            </p>

            <p>18. DISPUTES WITH OTHER USERS OR COLLECTORS</p>

            <p>
                You agree that you are solely responsible for your interactions with any other Users and Collectors in connection with the Services, Metarelics NFTs and Perks, and Metarelics will have no liability

            </p>

            <p>19. DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION</p>

            <p>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.</p>

            <p>Agreement to Arbitrate</p>

            <p>
                This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is referred to in these Terms as the “Arbitration Agreement.” You agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise 
                between you and Metarelics, whether arising out of or relating to these Terms (including any alleged breach thereof), the Services, Metarelics NFTs, Perks, any advertising, or any aspect of the 
                relationship or transactions between us, will be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except 
                that you may assert individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify. Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, 
                or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into these Terms, you and Metarelics are each waiving the right to a 
                trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement 
                of this Arbitration Agreement.
            </p>

            <p>Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief</p>

            <p>
                YOU AND METARELICS AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR 
                PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND METARELICS AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A 
                CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF
                AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S), EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY PURSUE A CLAIM FOR AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF UNDER 
                APPLICABLE LAW TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED FOR THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS PROVISION.
            </p>

            <p>Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution</p>

            <p>
                Metarelics is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer's satisfaction by emailing Metarelics at 
                info@metarelics.co. If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice 
                to Metarelics should be sent to Metarelics - 10953 E Tusayan Trl, Scottsdale, AZ 85255
            </p>

            <p>
                (“Notice Address”). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If Metarelics and you do not resolve the claim within 
                sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Metarelics may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Metarelics or 
                you will not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Metarelics is entitled.
            </p>

            <p>Arbitration Procedures</p>

            <p>
                Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association's (“AAA”) rules and procedures, including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules 
                (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For information on the AAA, please visit its website, http://www.adr.org. Information about the AAA Rules and fees 
                for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA's consumer arbitration page, https://www.adr.org/consumer. If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this 
                Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms 
                would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including 
                issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other 
                judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under these Terms and applicable law. Decisions by the 
                arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons. Unless Metarelics and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a 
                reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the 
                determination will be made by AAA. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, Metarelics agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents 
                submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined 
                by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions 
                on which the award is based.
            </p>

            <p>Costs of Arbitration</p>

            <p>
                Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the “Arbitration Fees”) will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement. 
                If the value of the relief sought is $75,000 or less, at your request, Metarelics will pay all Arbitration Fees. If the value of relief sought is more than $75,000 and you are able to demonstrate 
                to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your
                portion of the Arbitration Fees, Metarelics will pay your portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to 
                the costs of litigation, Metarelics will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. Any payment of attorneys' fees 
                will be governed by the AAA Rules.
            </p>

            <p>Confidentiality</p>

            <p>All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.</p>

            <p>Severability</p>

            <p>
                If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement (other than the subsection (b) above titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and 
                Non-Individualized Relief” above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest 
                to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement will be enforceable as so modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of 
                the provisions of subsection (b) above titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration 
                Agreement will be null and void, unless such provisions are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable solely with respect to claims for public injunctive relief. The remainder of these Terms will 
                continue to apply.
            </p>

            <p>Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement</p>

            <p>
                Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, Metarelics agrees that if it makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address) 
                while you are a User of the Services, you may reject any such change by sending Metarelics written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice Address provided above. 
                By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted 
                these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).
            </p>

            <p>
                If any provision of these Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions 
                as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms remain in full force and effect.
            </p>

            <p>22. ASSIGNABILITY</p>

            <p>
                You may not assign the Terms without the prior written consent of Metarelics, but Metarelics may assign or transfer these Terms, in whole or in part, without restriction.

            <p>23. GOVERNING LAW</p>

            <p>
                These Terms will be governed by the laws of the State of Oregon without regard to its conflict of law provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, 
                as set forth above, you and Metarelics submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within Portland, Oregon.
            </p>

            <p>24. MISCELLANEOUS</p>

            <p>
                These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Metarelics and govern your use of the Services, Metarelics NFTs, NFT IP and Perks, superseding any prior agreements between 
                you and Metarelics with respect thereto. Except as otherwise provided herein, these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third party 
                beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate or third party services, third party 
                content or third party software. The failure of Metarelics to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. You agree 
                that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Services, any Metarelics NFT, any Perks or these Terms must be 
                filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. A printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in electronic form will be admissible 
                in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally 
                generated and maintained in printed form. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Notices to you may be made via either email or 
                regular mail. Metarelics may also provide notices to you of changes to these Terms or other matters by displaying notices or links to notices generally on the Services.
